# projektor-rs

I guess its a [projektor](https://gitlab.com/derpystuff/projektor/) clone
in Rust :^)

## How to use?

Make sure you have rust and cargo installed.
Clone and build the project.

Run the generated executable with the first parameter as the build hash.

> NOTE: Build files which do not exist, i.e files wich have been deleted
> from discord's servers cannot be fetched and will return a 404
> which means, trying to download these builds is impossible
